### Example Usage

Hereâ€™s an example of how to use the configuration in your application:

```typescript
import { config } from './config'

const server = app.listen(config.port, config.host, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://${config.host}:${config.port}`)
})

console.log(`Database is located at: ${config.database}`)
console.log(
  `Global compression is ${config.compression.global ? 'enabled' : 'disabled'}`
)
```

## Adding Products

The `products.json` in the `database` folder file should contain an array of products that follow the structure described below. Each product must conform to the `Product` type.

Example `products.json`:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "27c85225-5398-4814-b180-70c01ba70848",
    "name": "Example Product 1",
    "category": "Furniture",
    "description": "This is a description of Example Product 1.",
    "price": "199.99",
    "image": "https://example.com/image1.jpg"
  },
  {
    "id": "27c85225-5398-4814-b180-70c01ba7194t",
    "name": "Example Product 2",
    "category": "Kitchen",
    "description": "This is a description of Example Product 2.",
    "price": "59.99",
    "image": "https://example.com/image2.jpg"
  }
]
```

### Product Type

Each product object must follow the Product type as shown below:

```typescript
type Product = {
  id: string
  name: string
  category: string
  description: string
  price: string
  image: string
}
```

- **id:** A unique (UUIDv4) identifier for the product (string).
- **name:** The name of the product (string).
- **category:** The category of the product, such as "Furniture" or "Kitchen" (string).
- **description:** A brief description of the product (string).
- **price:** The price of the product, stored as a string to allow formatting or special characters like currency symbols (string).
- **image:** A URL to the product image (string).

By adding your products to this file, the system will load and display them when the application starts, allowing you to prepopulate the product catalog with ease.
